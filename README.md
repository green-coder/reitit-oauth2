## Reitit-oauth2

This is a fork of [`ring-oauth2`](https://github.com/weavejester/ring-oauth2) designed to provide routes for a Reitit router rather than acting as a ring middleware.

See in `example/` on how to use it.

It won't be further maintained, won't be published as a library, use it as you want.
